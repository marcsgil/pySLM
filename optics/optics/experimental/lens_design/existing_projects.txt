In regards the optical lens design tool. Most people use Zemax OpticStudio: https://www.zemax.com/pages/try-opticstudio-for-free. There are some free, but limited, tools available such as http://www.qioptiq-shop.com/en/Optics-Software/Winlens-Optical-Design-Software/ 
It would be great to have an open source tool with a similar ease-of-use, combined with the all flexibility of Python.

There are many optical design Python projects on GitHub and PyPI. The following two seem quite active:
https://github.com/DCC-Lab/RayTracing with article https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/journals/neurophotonics/volume-8/issue-01/010801/Tools-and-tutorial-on-practical-ray-tracing-for-microscopy/10.1117/1.NPh.8.1.010801.full?SSO=1
https://github.com/mjhoptics/ray-optics             Jan 2023, import Zemax and CodeV, glass catalog, no optimization
https://github.com/mjhoptics/opticalglass           Oct 2022, Reads glasses from refractiveindex.info
https://github.com/cihologramas/pyoptools           Apr 2023, Can automatically load lenses from Thorlabs catalog. non-sequential   https://pyoptools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebooks/basic/00-Intro.html
https://github.com/rdemaria/pyoptics                Mar 2023, NOT for light? LHC beam focussing instead of light?

This one is less active but it seems rather complete:
https://github.com/draustin/otk                      Jun 2020, Zemax read, lookup in RefractiveIndex.INFO

And more:
